- âœ… Initial scheduler class structure
- âœ… Basic constraints defined
- âœ… Consecutive shifts validation (max 6 in a row)
- âœ… No Tuesday nights (in _initialize_empty_schedule)
- âœ… Shift transition rules (48h rest between day/night switches)
- âœ… PTO/RTO time blocking as hard constraints
- âœ… Updated resident types and shift requirements
- âœ… Added documentation to get_required_shifts
- âœ… OR-Tools solver integration
- âœ… Basic shift assignment constraints
- âœ… Block-based scheduling (28-day blocks)
- âœ… Support for multiple residents per shift
- âœ… Block transition day handling
- âœ… Improved logging system
- âœ… Day/night transition rest periods (upgraded to 72h for certain transitions)

### In Progress
- ðŸ”„ Re-enabling PGY1 supervision constraints
- ðŸ”„ Implementing minimum staffing requirements (specific staffing levels by pod/shift)
- ðŸ”„ PGY1 buddy system for Block 1
- ðŸ”„ Rotation flexibility handling
- ðŸ”„ Refactoring date handling from .days to actual dates to handle cross-month blocks correctly

## Next Steps

### Priority Tasks
1. Complete Scheduler Implementation
   - âœ… Update to use blocks instead of months
   - âœ… Add multi-resident shift support
   - âœ… Implement PTO as hard constraints
   - âœ… Fix consecutive shifts logic
   - âœ… Improve day/night transition constraints
   - â¬œ Re-enable and test PGY1 supervision constraints
   - â¬œ Finalize minimum staffing implementation
   - â¬œ Implement PGY1 buddy system
   - â¬œ Implement rotation-based scheduling

2. Testing
   - âœ… Add tests for block-based scheduling
   - âœ… Add tests for multi-resident shifts
   - â¬œ Add tests for minimum staffing requirements
   - â¬œ Add tests for PGY1 buddy system
   - â¬œ Test schedule generation with real data

### Core Constraints Status
âœ… Max 6 consecutive shifts
âœ… No Tuesday nights
âœ… Basic shift transition rules (48-72h rest between different shift types)
âœ… PTO/RTO handling as hard constraints
âœ… Block transition day handling
ðŸ”„ PGY1 supervision rules
ðŸ”„ Minimum staffing requirements
ðŸ”„ PGY1 buddy system for Block 1
âœ… Day/night transition rest periods

### Current Focus
- Re-enabling PGY1 supervision constraints
- Implementing minimum staffing requirements based on pod and shift type
- Ensuring PGY1 buddy system works for Block 1
- Testing generated schedules with real resident data

### Notes
- Using Google OR-Tools for constraint satisfaction
- JSON format established for resident data
- All resident types and shift requirements updated
- PTO/RTO rules implemented as hard constraints
- Block system implemented (28-day blocks)
- Multiple residents per shift supported
- Improved logging throughout the scheduler
- Generated test schedule for Block 1 of 2024

## Immediate Next Steps
1. Refactor date handling throughout the codebase to use actual dates instead of .days to correctly handle cross-month blocks
2. Re-enable and test PGY1 supervision constraints
3. Implement PGY1 buddy system for Block 1
4. Define and implement specific staffing requirements by pod/shift
5. Add comprehensive tests for all constraints
6. Generate and validate test schedules with full resident roster

## Questions to Resolve
- How to best handle swing shift assignments?
- Should we implement any maximum staffing limits?
- How to handle shift preferences?
- How to optimize resident distribution across shifts?
