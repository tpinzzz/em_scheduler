## Next Steps

### Priority Tasks
1. Complete Scheduling Algorithm
   - ✅ Implement `_setup_solver()` in Scheduler class
   - ✅ Implement constraint satisfaction using Google OR-Tools
   - ⬜ Implement `_convert_solution_to_schedule()` method
   - ⬜ Test complete schedule generation
   - ⬜ Add validation for edge cases
   - ⬜ Add additional shift type constraints
   - ⬜ Add fair distribution constraints

2. Additional Constraints to Implement
   - ⬜ Minimum number of specific shift types (e.g., nights)
   - ⬜ Maximum consecutive days off
   - ⬜ Fair distribution of weekend shifts
   - ⬜ Pod distribution rules
   - ⬜ Special case handling for unstaffed shifts

3. Testing
   - ⬜ Add tests for schedule generation
   - ⬜ Add tests for edge cases (PTO conflicts, etc.)
   - ⬜ Add integration tests
   - ⬜ Add tests for PGY1 supervision rules
   - ⬜ Add tests for shift distribution fairness

### Core Constraints Status
✅ Max 6 consecutive shifts
✅ No Tuesday nights
✅ Shift transition rules (48h between day/night switches)
✅ PTO/RTO handling
✅ Basic resident assignment constraints
✅ PGY1 supervision rules
⬜ Pod distribution rules
⬜ Minimum shifts by type
⬜ Maximum consecutive days off
⬜ Fair weekend distribution
⬜ Special case handling

### Questions to Resolve
- What are the minimum requirements for different shift types?
- How many consecutive days off should be allowed?
- How do we define "fair" for weekend shift distribution?
- How to handle shifts that can't be staffed?
- How to balance pod assignments for optimal distribution?
- How to handle conflicting scheduling preferences?

## Notes
- Currently using Google OR-Tools for constraint satisfaction
- JSON format established for resident data
- Basic error handling in place for data loading
- All resident types and shift requirements updated
- PTO/RTO rules documented in models.py
- PGY1 supervision rules implemented in SchedulingConstraints class

## Future Refactoring Considerations
### Shift Time Calculations
- Current shift time logic in validate_shift_transitions is complex
- Consider adding get_start_time() and get_end_time() methods to Shift class
- Would make time period calculations more explicit and maintainable
- Could improve test readability

### Priority:
- High: Complete the schedule generation implementation
- Medium: Add additional constraint implementations
- Medium: Expand test coverage
- Low: Refactor time calculations
