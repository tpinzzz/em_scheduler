# Development Status & Next Steps

## Current Implementation Status (as of Feb 13, 2025)

### Completed
- ✅ Basic project structure
- ✅ Data models (Resident, Shift, TimeOff)
- ✅ Sample data loading (residents.json)
- ✅ Initial scheduler class structure
- ✅ Basic constraints defined
- ✅ Consecutive shifts validation (max 6 in a row)
- ✅ No Tuesday nights (in _initialize_empty_schedule)
- ✅ Shift transition rules (48h rest between day/night switches)
- ✅ PTO/RTO time blocking
- ✅ Updated resident types and shift requirements
- ✅ Added documentation to get_required_shifts

### Current File Structure

│   ├── models.py      - Data structures & enums (Updated with all resident types)
│   ├── scheduler.py   - Core scheduling logic (partial implementation)
│   └── main.py        - Entry point & file I/O
├── tests/
│   ├── test_load.py   - Basic data loading tests

## Next Steps

### Priority Tasks
1. Complete Scheduling Algorithm
   - Implement `_setup_solver()` in Scheduler class
   - Implement constraint satisfaction using Google OR-Tools
   - Add shift assignment logic

2. Pod Distribution Implementation
   - Add logic for even pod distribution among residents
   - Add validation for pod assignments
   - Add tests for pod distribution

3. Testing
   - Add tests for schedule generation
   - Add tests for edge cases (PTO conflicts, etc.)
   - Add integration tests for full schedule generation

### Core Constraints Status
✅ Max 6 consecutive shifts
✅ No Tuesday nights
✅ Shift transition rules (48h between day/night switches)
✅ PTO/RTO handling
⬜ Pod distribution rules
⬜ Complete schedule generation

### Questions to Resolve
- How to balance pod assignments for optimal distribution?
- How to handle conflicting scheduling preferences?
- How to balance night/day shift distribution?

## Notes
- Currently using Google OR-Tools for constraint satisfaction
- JSON format established for resident data
- Basic error handling in place for data loading
- All resident types and shift requirements updated
- PTO/RTO rules documented in models.py


## Future Refactoring Considerations
### Shift Time Calculations
- Current shift time logic in validate_shift_transitions is complex and error-prone
- Consider adding get_start_time() and get_end_time() methods to Shift class
- Would make time period calculations more explicit and maintainable
- Could improve test readability

### Priority:
- Medium: Not blocking functionality but would improve maintainability
- Consider after core scheduling algorithm is complete
