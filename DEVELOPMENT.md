# Development Status & Next Steps

## Current Implementation Status (as of May 22, 2025)

### ✅ Completed & Working
- Basic project structure
- Data models (Resident, Shift, TimeOff, Block)
- Sample data loading (residents.json)
- OR-Tools solver integration
- Block-based scheduling (28-day blocks)
- Support for multiple residents per shift
- Block transition day handling
- Improved logging system
- PTO/RTO time blocking as hard constraints
- Day/night transition rest periods (48-72h between different shift types)
- Basic shift assignment constraints
- Required shift counts per resident (with PTO reduction logic)
- One shift per resident per day constraint
- Basic staffing requirements (at least 1 resident per regular shift)
- No Tuesday nights rule

### 🔄 Partially Complete (Refactoring in Progress)
- **File separation partially done**:
  - ✅ `src/models.py` - Clean data models
  - ✅ `src/constraints.py` - Basic constraint framework (buddy system, side allocation)
  - ✅ `src/validators.py` - Post-scheduling validation logic
  - ❌ `src/scheduler.py` - Still contains mixed responsibilities (400+ lines)

### 🚨 Known Issues & Disabled Features
- **Duplicate constraint classes**: Two `SchedulingConstraints` classes exist (constraints.py vs scheduler.py)
- **Critical constraints disabled** (commented out in scheduler.py):
  - PGY1 supervision requirements
  - Consecutive shifts validation (max 6 in a row)
  - PGY1 buddy system for Block 1
- **Mixed responsibilities**: scheduler.py handles both scheduling logic AND constraint definitions
- **Inconsistent imports**: Some files use relative imports, others don't

### ❌ Not Implemented
- Minimum staffing requirements (specific staffing levels by pod/shift)
- Rotation flexibility handling
- Shift preferences
- Maximum staffing limits
- Resident distribution optimization across shifts

## Immediate Priority Tasks

### 1. Complete Refactoring (HIGH PRIORITY)
- **Consolidate constraint classes**: Merge duplicate `SchedulingConstraints` classes
- **Extract constraints from scheduler.py**: Move all constraint logic to `constraints.py`
- **Clean up scheduler.py**: Focus only on scheduling algorithm and solver setup
- **Fix import inconsistencies**: Standardize import patterns across files

### 2. Re-enable Critical Constraints (HIGH PRIORITY)
- Re-enable PGY1 supervision constraints (currently commented out)
- Re-enable consecutive shift limits (max 6 consecutive shifts)
- Re-enable PGY1 buddy system for Block 1
- Test all re-enabled constraints

### 3. Implement Missing Features (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
- Minimum staffing requirements (specific levels by pod/shift)
- Advanced PGY1 buddy system implementation
- Rotation-based scheduling constraints

## Constraint Implementation Status

### Active Constraints ✅
- PTO/RTO blocking (hard constraints)
- Day/night transition rest periods (48-72h)
- Block transition day availability
- Required shift counts per resident
- One shift per resident per day
- Basic staffing (≥1 resident per regular shift)
- No Tuesday nights

### Disabled Constraints 🚨
- PGY1 supervision rules (commented out)
- Consecutive shift limits (commented out)
- PGY1 buddy system for Block 1 (commented out)
- Advanced minimum staffing requirements

### Validation-Only Features ✅
- Buddy system validation (Block 1 swing shifts = PGY2 only)
- Side allocation validation (max 4 residents/side in Block 1, 3 in others)

## Next Steps Roadmap

### Phase 1: Refactoring Cleanup
1. Consolidate `SchedulingConstraints` classes
2. Move all constraint logic out of `scheduler.py`
3. Standardize imports across all files
4. Update tests to use new structure

### Phase 2: Re-enable Core Constraints
1. Re-enable PGY1 supervision constraints
2. Re-enable consecutive shift limits
3. Re-enable PGY1 buddy system
4. Comprehensive testing of all constraints

### Phase 3: Feature Implementation
1. Implement advanced minimum staffing requirements
2. Add rotation-based scheduling
3. Implement shift preferences
4. Add resident distribution optimization

## Testing Status
- ✅ Basic data loading tests
- ✅ Block-based scheduling tests
- ✅ Multi-resident shift tests
- ✅ Constraint validation tests
- ⬜ Integration tests for re-enabled constraints
- ⬜ Performance tests with full resident roster

## Current Focus
**IMMEDIATE**: Complete the refactoring that was started to separate concerns properly. The scheduler is currently in a hybrid state with constraints scattered across multiple files and some critical features disabled.

## Questions to Resolve
- How to handle swing shift assignments optimally?
- Should we implement maximum staffing limits per shift?
- How to prioritize resident preferences vs constraint satisfaction?
- Performance optimization for larger resident rosters?

## Notes
- Using Google OR-Tools for constraint satisfaction
- JSON format established for resident data
- Block system implemented (28-day blocks starting July 1)
- Generated test schedule for Block 1 of 2024
- Logging system in place for debugging
